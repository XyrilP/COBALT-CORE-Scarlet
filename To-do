0. Make sure Scarlet works just fine in latest updates.
1. New Trick action and Trick status
    * Trick is Scarlet's equivalent of Ace.
        - Instead of gaining n Evade every turn, you get movement cards that you can play for free.
        - Trick cards are temporary and single use.
        - When gaining a "Trick" card, (U)ncommon and (R)are cards are weighted less compared to (C)ommon cards.
        - "Trick" cards are unattainable, like Peri's Glissade or Books' 
    * Trick n (action)
        - Gain n "Trick" cards.
    * Trick n (status)
        - Gain n "Trick" cards at start of your turn.
    * "Trick" cards
        - (C)Drift Left
            * Move Left 1
        - (C)Drift Right
            * Move Right 1
        - (C)Afterburn
            * Hermes 1
        - (U)Veer
            * Move Random 2
        - (U)Blink
            * Move Right 2, flippable
        - (R)Flicker
            * Move Random 1, Move Random 2, Move Random 3
    * Instant Trick
        - New action
            * Instant Trick n
            * Perform a Trick n amount of times when action is played
2. Fade nerfs
    * Proposed idea: Make Fade be set instead.
        - Prevents gaining a lot of Fade in a single turn.
        - Incentivizes using more expensive Fade cards (because you get more).
3. Rework Trick Action artifact
    * "Trick Action" becomes "Trickster"
    * Now grants a Trick card if you end your turn with more than 0 Energy. (Formerly grants 1 Fade)
4. Saturation Barrage changes
    * Saturation Barrage prioritizes midrow targets.
        - When making a Saturation Barrage attack, will randomly target midrow objects first before targeting the opposing ship.
5. Deck adjustments
    * New Starting Deck
        - Trick (replaces Hide & Sneak)
        - Sneak Attack
    * Removed cards
        - Veer
            * See above.
            * Veer becomes a Trick card.
    * New Cards
        - (C, 1E)Trick
            * Trick 1
            * Upgrade A: Trick 2
            * Upgrade B: Trick 3, exhaust
